# The-Last-Transmission
The Last Transmission is a sci-fi visual novel built in Renâ€™Py. As a lone technician stationed at Earth Lab, you monitor fading signals from orbit. Routine maintenance turns into something far stranger when an unexpected transmission breaks the silence. Some signals were never meant to be heard.
